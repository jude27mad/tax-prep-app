Drop files here to preload the guided wizard.

Supported automatically:
- TOML: copy user_data.toml or exports from the app
- JSON: keys like box14, box22, box16, box18, rrsp
- TXT: free-form notes; use “box14 72000” style lines
- CSV: first row with column headers matching the boxes

Still useful but requires manual typing:
- PDF or XLSX copies of slips (the wizard will remind you to open them locally)

The wizard always looks here after user_data.* in the project root.
